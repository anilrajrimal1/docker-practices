## 🚀 About This Project  
Welcome to **docker-practices**! This is where we take the chaos of running apps and cram it into neat little containers. Think of it as putting your messy room into a box and calling it "organized".  

If you're here, you're probably:  
1. Learning Docker.  
2. Breaking things.  
3. Pretending you know what's going on.  

Either way, you're in the right place.  

---

## 📦 What's Inside?  
- **Dockerfiles**: Because running stuff manually is *so* 2009.  
- **docker-compose.yml**: It's like Docker's multiplayer mode.  
- Random scripts: They work... probably.  
- Enough bugs to keep things exciting.  

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started  
1. **Clone this repo**:  
    ```bash  
    git clone git@github.com:anilrajrimal1/docker-practices.git
    cd docker-practices  
    ```  

2. **Build stuff(if Dockerfiles)**:  
    ```bash  
    docker build -t <give_image_tag> .  
    ```  

3. **Run stuff(if Dockerfile)**:  
    ```bash  
    docker run -it <give_same_image_tag> 
    ```  
4. **Run stuff(if docker-compose)**:  
    ```bash  
    docker compose up -d --build
    ``` 

5. **Break stuff**: This step is optional... but inevitable.

## 🤔 Why Docker?  
Because:  
- It’s cool.  
- People won’t hire you if you don’t know it.  
- Who doesn’t like containers?  

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Pro Tips  
- **If it works on your machine...** congratulations! It probably won't work anywhere else.  
- **`docker ps`**: Your daily "What did I just break?" command.  
- **`docker logs`**: Where the real drama happens.  

---

## 🐛 Bugs  
If you find any bugs, it's probably not a bug—it's a feature. But feel free to file an issue anyway.  

---

## 🏆 Contributions  
Feel free to fork, clone, and mess around. If you make something cool (or fix my mess), open a pull request.
